/**
 * File-backed durable {@link SpendStore}.
 *
 * Persists the daily spend accumulator to a JSON file on disk, preserving
 * cumulative spending totals across process restarts, crashes, and redeploys.
 *
 * ### Error semantics
 * - File absent (ENOENT): returns null — legitimately no spend recorded yet.
 * - File present but unreadable or malformed: throws — a safety control must
 *   fail closed, not assume nothing was spent.
 *
 * ### Write atomicity
 * Writes go to a tmp file that is unique per write (`<filePath>.<pid>.<random>.tmp`),
 * then `fs.rename` onto the target. `rename` is atomic within a filesystem, so
 * there is no window where the target file is truncated but not yet fully
 * written, and two writers can never share (and clobber, or `ENOENT` on) one
 * tmp file.
 *
 * ### Sharing the file between processes
 * `read()` + `write()` alone is not enough when several processes use the same
 * file (the MCP server and the E2E agent both default to
 * `~/.routedock/spend.json`): both can read the same total and both write back
 * `total + amount`. {@link FileSpendStore.update} closes that race — it holds an
 * exclusive lock file (`<filePath>.lock`, created with `O_EXCL`) across the
 * read, the callback and the write, and `RouteDockClient` uses it automatically.
 * `write()` takes the same lock, so every mutation is serialized.
 *
 * The lock is advisory and file-based: it works for processes on one machine
 * (and on filesystems with working `O_EXCL`), not for a file on a flaky network
 * share. A lock whose mtime goes stale (crashed holder) is broken after
 * `lockStaleMs`; a live holder keeps refreshing it. If the lock cannot be
 * acquired within `lockTimeoutMs`, the call rejects — it never proceeds
 * unlocked.
